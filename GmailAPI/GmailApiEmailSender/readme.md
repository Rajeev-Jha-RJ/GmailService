# Email Sending Options in .NET 8+

I'll provide you with code for three different approaches to send emails via Gmail in a .NET 8+ console application. Each has different authentication methods and capabilities for sending emails on behalf of a user while they're offline.

## Option 1: Gmail API (OAuth 2.0)

This is the most modern approach and recommended by Google. It allows your application to send emails on behalf of a user when they're offline using OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens.

## Option 2: SMTP with OAuth 2.0

This approach uses SMTP but authenticates using OAuth 2.0, which allows offline access.



## Option 3: IMAP Client with OAuth 2.0

This approach allows you to use IMAP for Gmail with OAuth 2.0, which supports offline access.



## Setting Up Authentication

For all three options, you'll need to:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project
   - Enable the Gmail API
   - Configure the OAuth consent screen
   - Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials
   - Download the credentials as `credentials.json`

2. **NuGet Dependencies**:
   - For Gmail API: `Google.Apis.Gmail.v1`
   - For SMTP/IMAP: `MailKit` and `Google.Apis.Auth`

## Recommendation

The **Gmail API** (Option 1) is the recommended approach because:

1. It's Google's officially recommended method for programmatic email access
2. It supports OAuth 2.0 with refresh tokens for offline access
3. It has detailed quota and monitoring capabilities
4. It's less likely to trigger security alerts than SMTP/IMAP

All three methods support sending emails while the user is offline, but the Gmail API provides the best combination of reliability, security, and modern authentication.
